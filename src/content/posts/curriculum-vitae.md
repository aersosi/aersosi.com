Astro’s appeal isn’t just in the websites it builds—it’s in *how* you build them. For developers, the experience of working with Astro feels refreshingly modern, minimal, and fast.

### Minimal setup, maximum results

Astro gives you a solid starting point without overloading you with decisions. Add Tailwind, bring in React components, or keep it 100% HTML—Astro stays out of your way.

Features devs appreciate:
- Zero-config defaults  
- File-based routing  
- Markdown support with frontmatter  
- Seamless integration with CMSs and APIs  

### A joy to work with

The best tools make you feel productive and in control. Astro’s developer experience lets you build confidently and iterate quickly—without fighting configuration or wrestling with JS bloat.

It’s the kind of workflow that makes you think, *“Why weren’t we building this way all along?”*
