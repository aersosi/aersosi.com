One of the best parts of working with Astro is how little you need to create something powerful. You can start with just a Markdown file—and end up with a polished, production-ready site.

### Markdown is the foundation

Astro supports `.md` and `.mdx` files out of the box, making it a dream for writers, bloggers, and documentation builders. Each file becomes a page, and you control layout with frontmatter and layout components.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";
import sitemap from "@astrojs/sitemap";
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx";
// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    plugins: [tailwindcss()],
  },
  markdown: {
    drafts: true,
    shikiConfig: {
      theme: "css-variables",
    },
  },
  shikiConfig: {
    wrap: true,
    skipInline: false,
    drafts: true,
  },
  site: "https://yourdomain.com",
  integrations: [sitemap(), mdx()],
});
```

Why it’s great for content creators:

- Clean, readable syntax
- Frontmatter controls metadata
- Supports components via MDX
- Easy to version and manage in Git

### Styling your story

With Astro’s component-based architecture, you can apply custom styles, inject interactive blocks, and reuse layouts—all while keeping your content separate from your presentation.

Pair it with Tailwind CSS or your own design system for complete control.

### Publish like a pro

Once you’re ready, deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or your own server. No complicated build tools, no bloated runtimes—just fast, static output ready to go.

Whether you're a solo blogger or building docs for your next startup, Astro gives you everything you need to publish with confidence.

        I’m a self-taught front-end developer and UI designer with a strong
        passion for building my own projects. My philosophy revolves around
        simplicity and practicality, focusing on straightforward principles that
        deliver results. I value sticking to a clear plan and executing it
        reliably, with consistency being the foundation that keeps everything on
        track.
