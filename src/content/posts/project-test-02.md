Astro’s biggest selling point is its use of **islands architecture**—but what does that really mean, and how does it impact your projects?

### Traditional frameworks vs. islands

Most JavaScript frameworks hydrate the entire page at runtime, even for static content. Astro takes a smarter approach: only hydrate the interactive parts (islands), and leave the rest as fast, static HTML.

In practice, this means:
- Faster page loads  
- Less JavaScript shipped  
- Better performance on slower devices  
- Fewer layout shifts and smoother interactions  

### Great UX without overengineering

Astro’s architecture is ideal for content-rich sites that still need dynamic components—like search bars, comment forms, or tabs. You can use React, Vue, or Svelte *only where needed*, keeping the rest lean and fast.

### Why learners should care

Understanding how islands architecture works gives you a strong foundation in modern web performance. It teaches you to **think critically about what your site needs**, and how to deliver it efficiently.

In short: Astro’s islands model isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a better way to build.
